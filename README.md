# Generating transmission trees using a branching process model

This code has been adapted from cmmid/ringbp developed by @jhellewell14

## Usage (1): using pre-run simulated networks

Load one of files ```output/sim1```, ```output/sim2``` etc. as a ```transmission_network_file``` in FAVITES. 

## Usage (2): Running with different parameters

Set your working directory to the home directory of this project 

```r
library(data.table)
library(dplyr)
source("R/scenario_sim.R")
```

### Example: Generate n transmission chains

Run n.sim simulations.

```r

tt <- scenario_sim(n.sim = 1,  # number of simulations
                              cap_cases = 100, # minimum number of cases
                              cap_max_days = 100, # minimum number of days (simulation stops after either min cases or min days has been reached in n-1 generation
                              num.initial.cases = 1,  # number of initial infected individuals
                              initial.case.adult = FALSE, # whether initial case is an adult or a child
                              prop.asym = 0,   # probability of asymptomatic infection
                              prop.seq = 1,   # proportion of symptomatic cases that are sequenced
                              r0community = 2.5,  # population R0 
                              disp.com = 0.16,  # dispersal parameter (of neg binom distribution) of community reproduction numbers
                              rel.infectiousness.c = 1, # relative infectiousness of child infections to adult infections
                              rel.susceptibility.c = 1, # relative susceptibility of child infections to adult infections
                              k = 0,  # skew parameter to sample serial interval from incubation period distribution
                              ####### final parameters not needed for tranmission chain generation (assuming no isolation / quarantine)
                              r0isolated = 0,  # R0 for isolated cases
                              disp.iso = 1,  # dispersal parameter (of neg binom distribution) of reproduction numbers
                              prop.ascertain = 0, # probability of detecting case for isolation
                              quarantine = FALSE) #whether quarantine is implemented
```


### Output

A data.table with the following variables $:

```r

sim.number #id of simulation / chain
exposure # time of infection since infection of index 
asym # logical whether asyptomatic
sequenced #logical whether sequenced
caseid # individual id
infector # individual id of infector
adult #logical whether adult (20y) or child (<20y)
onset # time of symptom onset (not Inf for asymptomatic)
sample # time of sample / sequence taken
new_cases #number of new cases generated by each individual
missed # not needed: missed for contact tracing
isolated_time # not needed: time of isolation
isolated #not needed: logical whether isolated
week  #not needed: week of case infection 

```
Also saves ```r n.sim``` files which are needed as ```transmission_network_file``` in FAVITES. 

## Underlying model: Model and parameters

A transmission chain is generated using a branching process model. The following assumptions are made:

- There are two age groups (0-19, child , 20+ adult) who contact each other as per the POLYMOD study (parameterised using socialmixr R package). This 2x2 contact matrix is C.
- The relative infectiousness, *f_i* and susceptibility, *g_i* of age group *i* are set as input parameters
- An unscaled matrix, U is then calculated using the following elements: *U_{i,j} = f_ig_jC_{i,j}*.
- The next generation matrix, *N*,  is then calculated by *N = (R_0 / \lambda) U*  where *\lambda* is the spectral radius of *U*.
- The 2x2 matrix *N = N_{i,j}* provides the mean number of infections in group *j* caused by an infection in age group *i*
- The branching process offspring distribution for each infection in age group *i* to age group *j* ~ negbin(mean = *N_{i,j}*, disp.comm) where disp.comm is the dispersion parameter for the reproductive numbers.

- There is a fixed probability that a case is sequenced (conditional on their being symptomatic)
- There is a fixed probability that an infection is symptomatic
- There is a delay from onset of symptoms to being sampled/sequenced
